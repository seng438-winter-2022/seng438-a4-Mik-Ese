# Why do we need mutation testing? Advantages and disadvantages of mutation testing
Mutation testing allows for developers to see if the current program is able to catch more complex or rare errors. It also can help developers see if conditions for loops or if statements can be exploited. In general, mutation testing is another way to see how faults can be introduced by either the software or users.

The advantages of mutation testing include being able to find more faults, having more metrics to improve test suites and providing a more thorough check of the program.

The disadvantages of mutation testing include the amount of time and resources needed to implement it. Mutation testing takes a lot of time and a decent amount of computation power to automate, which slows down the development process.
